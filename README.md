# DM Dashboard

Dashboard for D&D (5e) Dungeon Masters. I'm sure someone has already done it, but I don't play with web programming very much and wanted to give it a go. Current implementation is TypeScript, with plans for eventual migration to something like Elm or ClojureScript.

### Developing
Update `main.ts` and run `tsc main.ts` (with TypeScript installed) to recompile.
